# toolbar-disappearing

Trying to replicate a bug where the Toolbar Disappears on iPhone
after using the Capacitor Share Plugin and sharing a text message
with at least a few paragraphs worth of text.

It does fine with smaller amounts of text.

It also seems to work with sharing via email.

HOW IT SHOULD NOT LOOK WITH TOOLBAR OFF THE SCREEN:
